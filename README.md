## Observation

## Time Series Analysis:
Based on the ARMA Model and ARIMA Model, the forecast shows that the Yen would go down. It also got proven by the volatility forecasting. Therefore, it is not a good time to long Yen. Based on the model evaluation, I feel more confident about making trading decision because it not only predits the price change, but also predits the volatility.

### Regression Analysis
By using Linear Regression Model, it shows that the In-sample Root Mean Squared Error (0.5962) is close to Out-of-Sample Root Mean Squared Error which is 0.415. In conclusion, Linear Regression Model can be used to predict Yen rate change.
